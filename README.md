# Machine Learning in Healthcare Techniques

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of machine learning models and techniques applied in various healthcare domains. The focus is on medical image analysis, signal processing, and disease classification to assist in early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis.

## Models and Notebooks
The repository includes Jupyter notebooks implementing different machine learning and deep learning techniques for healthcare applications:

### **Medical Image Classification and Segmentation**
1. **Adenocarcinoma Gland Segmentation** – Identifies and segments adenocarcinoma glands in histopathological images.
2. **Automated Dermatological Lesion Classification System** – Detects and classifies skin lesions, including melanoma and benign conditions.
3. **Pathological Myopia Segmentation and Prediction Techniques** – Segments and predicts myopic progression.
4. **Punctured Lung Detection** – Identifies pneumothorax conditions in chest X-rays.

### **Medical Signal Processing**
5. **ECG Signal Categorization Using Wavelet Analysis** – Analyzes electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for arrhythmia classification.
